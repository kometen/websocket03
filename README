This is a server written in C++  that uses websockets and json.
Websocket is provided by websocketpp and json by nlohmann / json.

The purpose of this server is to send a football (european soccer)
table to a webclient. The client can start a match, update how many
goals are scored, and will update the table accordingly.

Every time a goal is added the server update a database, currently
postgresql, and if points needs to be added or taken away, it will
do so.

When changes are made they are pushed back to the client. The table
is sorted on the client.

JSON is used to transmit data. I looked at messagepack to serialize
but I could not get C++ messagepack to work for me so I just stuck
to sending plain JSON atm.

Messagepack worked when sending from the client. Probably my bad.
